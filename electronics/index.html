            <td><p><img alt="" src="/alevel/img/ramp_generator.svg"><br>
An op-amp ramp generator has a similar design to an inverting amplifier<br>
Since the output is not saturated and the non-inverting input is grounded, the difference between the two inputs is effectively zero and there is a virtual ground at the inverting input, so \(V_- = V_+ = \SI{0}{\volt}\)<br>
Since the op-amp draws no current, the current across the resistor is equal to the current acress the capacitor<br>
The output voltage is:<br>
\[\begin{alignat}{2}<br>
&amp; Q_C &amp;&amp; = CV_C<br>
\\ \implies &amp; \int I_C \mathrm{d}t &amp;&amp; = C(V_- - V_{out})<br>
\\ \implies &amp; \int I_R \mathrm{d}t &amp;&amp; = -CV_{out}<br>
\\ \implies &amp; V_{out} &amp;&amp; = -\frac{1}{C}\int \frac{V_R}{R} \mathrm{d}t<br>
\\ &amp; &amp;&amp; = -\frac{1}{RC}\int V_{in} - V_- \mathrm{d}t<br>
\\ &amp; &amp;&amp; = -\frac{1}{RC}\int V_{in} \mathrm{d}t<br>
\\ &amp; &amp;&amp; = -\frac{1}{RC}V_{in}t<br>
\end{alignat}\]<br>
<img alt="" src="/alevel/img/schmitt_trigger.svg"><br>
A non-inverting Schmitt trigger has a similar design to an inverting amplifier with positive feedback instead of negative, causing the system to be unstable and switching very rapidly rather than stable<br>
Since the output is saturated and the inverting input is grounded, the non-inverting output is not necessarily zero, but the trip point occurs when the inverting input reaches zero, so when \(V_+ = V_- = \SI{0}{\volt}\)<br>
Since the op-amp draws no current, the currents across the resistors are equal<br>
The trip points occur at:<br>
\[\begin{align}<br>
&amp; I_{in} = I_{out}<br>
\\ \implies &amp; \frac{V_{1}}{R_{in}} = \frac{V_f}{R_f}<br>
\\ \implies &amp; V_{in} - V_+ = \frac{R_{in}}{R_f}(V_+ - V_{out})<br>
\\ \implies &amp; V_{in} = -\frac{R_{in}}{R_f}V_{out}<br>
\end{align}\]<br>
where output voltage can be either the positive or negative saturation value<br>
<img alt="" src="/alevel/img/triangle_wave_generator.svg"><br>
By connecting the ramp generator to the Schmitt trigger in a feedback loop, the ramp generator can be made to trip the Schmitt trigger when it saturates, thereby causing the input to switch to the equal but opposite-signed voltage, causing it to ramp in the opposite direction and generating a triangle wave</p></td>
