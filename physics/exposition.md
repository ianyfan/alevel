1 Particles cannot instantaneously produce a force on each other, as this instantaneous action at a distance would violate the upper limit of speed of propagation of information in special relativity
\ Instead, particles exchange virtual particles, which, between two elementary particles, causes an equal and opposite force in both
\ They are virtual because they cannot be observed directly, but can be inferred to exist

\ When two charged particles interact via the electromagnetic force, a virtual photon is exchange between them

1 The photoelectric effect is the observation that directing electromagnetic radiation onto a metal only above a certain frequency, depending on the metal, causes it to instantly emit electrons from the surface
\ This behaves contrary to classical physics, which would predict that the effect should be observed whatever the frequency, and less energy the light has (in terms of intensity or frequency/wavelength), the longer it should take before the metal began to emit electrons, since a wave would provide the metal with energy over time until it had enough for an electron to escape
\ The photoelectric effect is observed because the energy is quantised in packets, photons, 
\ The work function is the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from the surface of a metal
\ The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency required to be directed onto the metal so that a photon can provide an electron with enough energy to escape

\ Amplitude is the maximum displacement of an oscillating particle
\ Frequency is the number of oscillations per second
\ Wavelength is the distance between two adjacent crests
\ Speed is frequency multiplied by wavelength
\ Phase is the fraction of the wave cycle elapsed relative to the origin
\ Path difference is the difference in phase of two waves with the same frequency

2.3.2
1 Longitudinal waves displace along the same line as the direction of travel, such as sound waves
\ Transverse waves displace perpendicular to the direction of travel, such as light waves
2 Polarisation allows oscillation in just one direction, so another polarisation in the perpendicular direction blocks all transverse waves

2.3.3
1 The refractive index of a substance is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum divided by the speed of light in the substance
3 At the boundary between two different substances, the light wave changes angle determined by the refractive indices of the substances
4 Total internal reflection occurs when the sine of the angle required in the second substance is too high, greater than 1, so no light refracts

2.3.6
1 When a wave, such as light, passes through a thin slit, it diffracts, spreading out in the shape of a semicircle; the diffraction waves generated at different points in the slit interfere with each other, resulting in the formation of a diffraction pattern
2 A diffraction grating expands the double-slit concept to several slits, with the interference from multiple diffraction waves reinforcing the diffraction pattern to produce clear lines of constructive interference at certain angles
\ A spectrometer can use the produced angles of interference to calculate the wavelengths present in the incoming light
3 By comparing two adjacent slits, the results of interference at different angles of diffraction can be determined by considering the extra distance travelled from the farther slit: if the light travels an extra integer number of wavelengths, then they are at the same point of the cycle, causing the waves to constructively interfere
\ Since the extra distance travelled is \\(d\sin\theta\\) where \\(d\\) is the slit separation and \\(\theta\\) is the angle of diffraction, with the wavelength \\(\lambda\\), this gives rise to the equation \\(d\sin\theta = n\lambda\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer, the order number
\ The maximum order number can be found by considering that the angle cannot be greater than 90Â°: \\(n < \frac{d}{\lambda}\\)

4 In a closed system, momentum is conserved
5 The elasticity of a collision between two bodies denotes the ratio of the difference in velocity after the collision to before the collision
\ A completely elastic collision results in the two bodies moving apart at the same speed as before the collision

1 Otherwise the body would move in a straight line tangent to the circle
\ The centripetal force is towards the centre of the circle
2 Angular velocity is the rate of change of angular displacement, and is measured in radians per second
3 Centripetal acceleration is the acceleration required to keep the body on a circular path
4 From \\(F = ma\\)
5 Rudimentary derivation:
\ ![](../img/centripetal_acceleration.svg)
\ From \\(s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2\\), \\(u = 0\\) so \\(s = \frac{1}{2}a\delta t^2\\)
\ But \\((s+r)^2 = r^2 + (v\delta t)^2\\)
\ So \\(s^2 + 2sr = v^2\delta t^2\\)
\ \\(\implies \frac{1}{4}a^2\delta t^4 + ar\delta t^2 = v^2\delta t^2\\)
\ \\(\implies \frac{1}{4}a^2\delta t^2 + ar = v^2\\)
\ \\(\delta t\\) tends to 0, so \\(ar = v^2\\)

\ This gives \\(T = \frac{1}{f} = 2\pi\sqrt\frac{m}{k}\\)
2 The force of a mass oscillating on the end of a pendulum is \\(F = -mg\sin\theta\\) so \\(a = -g\sin\theta\\)
\ At small values of \\(\theta\\) (\\(<\SI{10}{\degree}\\)), \\(\sin\theta \approx \frac{x}{L}\\), so \\(a = -\frac{g}{l}x\\), which is the form for shm, where \\((2\pi f)^2 = \frac{g}{l}\\)
\ This gives \\(T = \frac{1}{f} = 2\pi\sqrt\frac{l}{g}\\)
3 The potential energy stored in the spring as measured from the origin is \\(E_p = \frac{1}{2}kx^2\\)
\ Since it is a closed system, energy is conserved, so at the maximum displacement, where kinetic energy is 0, the total energy is equal to the potential energy, so \\(E_t = \frac{1}{2}kA^2\\), where \\(A\\) is the amplitude
\ It follows that the kinetic energy is equal to \\(E_k = E_t - E_p = \frac{1}{2}k(A^2 - x^2)\\)
\ The velocity is \\(v = \pm\sqrt\frac{2E_k}{m} = \pm\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}(A^2 - x^2)}\\)
\ Since \\((2\pi f)^2 = \frac{k}{m}\\), \\(v = \pm\sqrt{(2Ï€f)^2(A^2 - x^2)} = \pm 2\pi f\sqrt{(A^2 - x^2)}\\)

4.1.5
1 Free vibrations occur without an input force at the natural frequency of the system
\ Forced vibrations have a periodic force applied to keep it oscillating
2 Resonance occurs when the frequency of forced vibrations is equal to the natural frequency and in phase with the velocity, causing the amplitude to become very large
\ Damping reduces the sharpness of resonance
3 When the system is in resonance, the driver is \\(\frac{\pi}{2}\\) out of phase with the driven system

1 In a magnetic field, a current-carrying wire perpendicular to the direction of the field experiences a force perpendicular to both, namely the direction in which the magnetic effect of the current counteracts the field
2 \\(F\\) is the force in newtons
\ \\(B\\) is the magnetic flux density in teslas
\ \\(I\\) is the current in the wire in amperes
\ \\(l\\) is the length of the wire in metres

3 However, the direction is opposite to the rate of change
4 If moving straight conductor has length \\(l\\) and moves a distance \\(s\\), then the change in flux linkage \\(\Delta\Phi = B\Delta A = Bl\Delta s\\), so the induced emf \\(\varepsilon = N\frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t} = 1\frac{Bl\Delta s}{\Delta t} = Bl\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} = Blv\\)
5 The flux linkage \\(N\Phi = BAN\sin\theta = BAN\sin(\omega t)\\) so the induced emf \\(\varepsilon = \frac{N\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t} = N\frac{\Delta(BA\sin(\omega t))}{\Delta t} = BAN\frac{\Delta(\sin(\omega t))}{\Delta t} = BAN\omega\cos(\omega t)\\)

7 A transformer transfers energy from one circuit, the primary circuit, to another, the secondary circuit; it consists of two coils wound round a common iron core; an alternating current in the primary coil induces an alternating magnetic field in the core, which in turn induces an alternating current in the secondary coil
8 By comparing the energy in the circuit after transformation to before
\ Transformers are almost 100% efficient
9 Resistance in the wire causes heating equal to \\(I^2R\\)
\ Eddy currents are induced in the iron core, which is minimised by partitioning the core with insulating layers
\ Energy is wasted to repeatedly magnetise and demagnetise the iron core
10 Since the power wasted is proportional to current squared, and inversely proportional to voltage squared, it is much more efficient energy efficient to transfer electrical power at high voltage
\ Transformers are used in transmission by stepping-up the voltage before transmission and stepping-down the voltage after transmission

1 In a simple molecular model, particles are modelled as point masses that travel randomle in a straight line until colliding with the boundary or another particle, which exerts a force
\ Increasing the volume decreases the pressure since the particles have to travel farther, so impact with the boundary less often, therefore reducing the pressure
\ Increasing the pressure increases the temperature since the particles move faster, so impact with the boundary more often, therefore raising the pressure
2 \\(c_{rms}\\) is the root mean square speed of the molecules of gas
\ Assumptions:
\
\ * the molecules are point masses, so the volume of one is negligible compared to the whole gas
\ * there are no intermolecular forces, otherwise this would reduce the force of impact with the boundary
\ *
\ * the collisions are elastic, so there is no loss of energy
\ * the collision time is negligible compared to the time between impacts
\ Derivation:
\
\ * consider a molecule of gas with mass \\(m\\) in a cuboid container with dimensions \\(l_x, l_y, l_z\\) in the \\(x, y, z\\) axes respectively
\ * suppose the velocity vector of the molecule is \begin{pmatrix}u\\\v\\\w\end{pmatrix} then the speed of the molecule is \\(c^2 = u^2 + v^2 + w^2\\)
\ * considering, without loss of generality, just the motion in the x-direction, the time between collisions with one of the faces is \\(t = \frac{2l_x}{u}\\) and the change in momentum of the collision is \\((-mu - mu = -2mu\\)
\ * therefore, the force on the molecule is \\(F = \frac{\Delta(mv)}{\Delta t} = \frac{-2mu}{\frac{2l_x}{u}} = -\frac{mu^2}{l_x}\\), which, by Newton's third law of motion, is equal and opposite to the force on the face
\ * thus, the pressure of the molecule on the face is \\(p = \frac{-F}{A} = \frac{\frac{mu^2}{l_x}}{l_yl_z} = \frac{mu^2}{l_xl_yl_z} = \frac{mu^2}{V}\\) where \\(V\\) is the volume of the container
\ * now considering N molecules in the container, each with a mass of \\(m\\), with the nth molecule having velocity vector \begin{pmatrix}u_n\\\v_n\\\w_n\end{pmatrix} and exerting a pressure of \\(p_1\\) on the face, the total pressure on the face is \\[p_u = \sum^N_{n=1}\frac{mu_n^2}{V} = \frac{m}{V}\sum^N_{n=1}u_n^2 = \frac{m}{V}N\overline{u^2}\\]
\ * since the x-direction was chosen without loss of generality, it follows that the pressure in the other two directions are \\(p_v = \frac{m}{V}N\overline{v^2}\\) and \\(p_w = \frac{m}{V}N\overline{w^2}\\)
\ * therefore, the mean pressure on a face is \\(p = \frac{p_u + p_v + p_w}{3} = \frac{1}{3}(\frac{m}{V}N\overline{u^2} + \frac{m}{V}N\overline{v^2} + \frac{m}{V}N\overline{w^2}) = \frac{1}{3V}Nm(\overline{u^2} + \overline{v^2} + \overline{w^2}) = \frac{1}{3V}Nmc_{rms}^2\\) since \\[c_{rms}^2 = \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}{c_n^2} = \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}(u_n^2 + v_n^2 + w_n^2) = \\frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}{u_n^2} + \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}{v_n^2} + \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}{w_n^2} = \overline{u^2} + \overline{v^2} + \overline{w^2}\\]
\ * rearranging gives \\(pV = \frac{1}{3}Nmc_{rms}^2\\)

6.2.2
1 Non-flow processes are changes of a gas that does not flow across the boundary of its container
\ Isothermal changes occur at a constant temperature
\ Adiabatic changes do not allow heat transfer to or from the gas, so it may have a different temperature to the outside system
\ Constant pressure changes occur at a constant pressure
\ Constant volume changes occur at a constant volume
2 This is the ideal gas law
3 \\(\gamma\\) is the adiabatic index, and is necessary since the lack of heat transfer causes the temperature to change, rising with pressure
4 This follows directly from the ideal gas law since \\(T\\) is assumed to be constant
