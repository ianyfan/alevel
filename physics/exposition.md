1 Particles cannot instantaneously produce a force on each other, as this instantaneous action at a distance would violate the upper limit of speed of propagation of information in special relativity
\ Instead, particles exchange virtual particles, which, between two elementary particles, causes an equal and opposite force in both
\ They are virtual because they cannot be observed directly, but can be inferred to exist
2 ![](/alevel/img/electromagnetic_interaction.svg)
\ When two charged particles interact via the electromagnetic force, a virtual photon is exchange between them
\ Since photons are massless, they can travel an infinite distance, which is why the electromagnetic force has an infinite range
3 The weak interaction is an interaction that affects hadrons & leptons and can cause quarks to change flavour, which is responsible for radioactive decay
\ The exchange particle is the W boson, which is charged and has a relatively high mass, so short-lived, resulting in a range of less than \\(\SI{0.001}{\femto\metre}\\)

1.2.1
1 The photoelectric effect is the observation that directing electromagnetic radiation onto a metal only above a certain frequency, depending on the metal, causes it to instantly emit electrons from the surface
\ This behaves contrary to classical physics, which would predict that the effect should be observed whatever the frequency, and less energy the light has (in terms of intensity or frequency/wavelength), the longer it should take before the metal began to emit electrons, since a wave would provide the metal with energy over time until it had enough for an electron to escape
\ The photoelectric effect is observed because the energy is quantised in packets, photons, 
\ The work function is the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from the surface of a metal
\ The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency required to be directed onto the metal so that a photon can provide an electron with enough energy to escape

1.2.2
1 The electron volt is the amount of energy gained by an electron moving across an electric potential difference of one volt
\ \\(\SI{1}{\electronvolt} = \SI{1.6\cdot 10^{-19}}{\joule}\\)
2 Ionisation is the process of creating ions by providing an electron in an atom with enough energy to escape all energy levels
\ Excitation is the gain of energy by an electron in an atom which gives it the exact energy required to raise energy levels
\ In a fluorescent tube, free electrons can ionise atoms of the gas or vapour
\ Passing electrons or photons can also excite electrons in an atom

1.2.3
1 A line spectrum is the pattern of light unique to an element that shows the various energies of light emitted when the electrons de-excite
\ An emission spectrum can be produced by directing the light produced from an excited gas through a prism or diffraction grating
\ An absorption spectrum can be produced by shining white light through a gas and directing the resulting light through a prism or diffraction grating, producing the inverse of an emission spectrum
\ The energy of the photon that is emitted when an electron de-excites is equal to the difference in energy of the levels
\ Fluorescence occurs when certain materials absorb ultraviolet light because an electron absorbs a photon, exciting it up multiple energy levels, before cascading down more than one energy level, releasing photons with lower energy than the incoming photon, which can put the frequency in the visible spectrum

\ The resistance of a filament lamp increases with voltage
2 \\(V = IR\\)

1.3.3
1 \\(R\\) is the resistance, \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area, \\(L\\) is the length
\ This assumes a resistor/conductor with a uniform cross section, flow of current and material, such as a length of wire
2 The resistance of a metal conductor increases with temperature
\ The resistance of a thermistor decreases as the temperature increases
\ The change of resistance means that a thermister can be used to make a temperature sensor
3 This means that a current passes without losing energy so there is no waste to heating
\ Electromagnets made from superconductors are much more powerful and cheaper than conventional electromagnets since there is no heat dissipation
\ Superconductors can be used in power cables to transfer electrical energy with perfect efficiency

1.3.4

2 Resistors in parallel decrease the resistance
4 Current does not change in a series circuit
\ The voltage across the branches of a parallel circuit is the same
5 The voltage across branches of parallel circuits are the same, but the currents aren't necessarily
\ The sum of the currents in branches of parallel circuits is equal to the current in the incoming branch

1.3.5
1 A potential divider provides part of the supply voltage that is defined by the resistors used according to the equation \\(R = \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}\\)
\ Using a variable resistor thereby varies the output voltage

1.3.6
1 \\(r\\) is the internal resistance of the e.m.f. source
\ For a fixed-voltage power supply, the internal resistance limits the possible current provided
2 Since the voltage is low and the current must be high, the internal resistance has to be very low
\ Connecting cells in parallel instead of in series allows it to drive a higher current, even though the power provided is the same

1.3.7

2 The resultant force has magnitude \\(\sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2}\\) and angle \\(\arctan\frac{F_2}{F_1}\\)
3 Equilibrium can be calculated by resolving forces in all dimensions to zero
\ Equilibrium can be shown in a scale drawing by adding the vectors so that the last vector goes back to the original starting point, producing a closed shape

2.1.2
1 The terms torque and moment are interchangeable
\ It uses the unit Newton metre \\(\si{\newton\metre}\\)
2 A couple is a pair of equal and opposite forces that do not act on the same line, thereby producing torque
3 The principle of moments is that for a system in equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments are equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments
4 The centre of mass of a body is the point at which a force does not produce torque
\ A body is stable if its centre of mass is above its base

\ The gradient of a displacement-time graph is the velocity
\ The gradient of a velocity-time graph is the acceleration
\ The area under a velocity-time graph is the displacement
4 Terminal speed is the speed of freefall at which the acceleration due to gravity is equal to the decceleration due to air resistance

2 Hooke's law states that the forces required to stretch a spring is the directly proportional to the distance stretched, up to the elastic limit, past which the spring deforms irrevocably
3 A stretched body is under tension
\ Tensile strain is the ratio length stretched to original length \\(\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}\\)
\ Tensile stress is the ratio tension to cross-sectional area: \\(\sigma = \frac{T}{A}\\)
4 Elastic strain energy is the energy stored in a stretched elastic body
\ Breaking stress is the point past which an elastic body loses its strength, extending and becoming narrower as more tensile stress is put upon it
5 \\(\text{Energy} = \text{average force} * \text{extension} = \frac{1}{2}F\Delta L\\)
6 Plastic deformation occurs when a material is stretched beyond the elastic point such that it does not return to its original shape when the force is removed; if it does, the deformation is elastic
\ Brittle materials have a rigid structure, so will not display plastic behaviour and, and break when the force is too great without and noticeable yield
\ Fractures occur in brittle materials when stress causes cracks in the material to grow until it breaks completely; fractures do not occure in plastic materials because atoms can move to stop the cracks from growing

2.3.1
1 Mechanical waves propagate by the oscillation of particles in a medium
\ Amplitude is the maximum displacement of an oscillating particle
\ Frequency is the number of oscillations per second
\ Wavelength is the distance between two adjacent crests
\ Speed is frequency multiplied by wavelength
\ Phase is the fraction of the wave cycle elapsed relative to the origin
\ Path difference is the difference in phase of two waves with the same frequency

2.3.2
1 Longitudinal waves displace along the same line as the direction of travel, such as sound waves
\ Transverse waves displace perpendicular to the direction of travel, such as light waves
2 Polarisation allows oscillation in just one direction, so another polarisation in the perpendicular direction blocks all transverse waves
\ Since light (and EM waves in general) gets blocked by this, it shows that light is a transverse wave
\ Radio transmitters are polarised, so receivers must be rotated in the same direction in order to receive the strongest signal

2.3.3
1 The refractive index of a substance is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum divided by the speed of light in the substance
3 At the boundary between two different substances, the light wave changes angle determined by the refractive indices of the substances
4 Total internal reflection occurs when the sine of the angle required in the second substance is too high, greater than 1, so no light refracts
5 Fibre optics are cladded with a substance with a lower refractive index than the core so that light travelling down it undergoes total internal reflection, allowing transmission of information that is fast and lossless
\ However, the refractive index must still be high so that the critical angle is high, to prevent multipath dispersion, wherein light travelling at a greater angle reflects more, thereby travelling a longer path so that different components of the signal arrive at different times, distorting it
\ Multipath dispersion is also mitigated by having a narrow core

2.3.4
1 A stationary wave can be formed by two waves with the same frequency and wavelength (and amplitude) travelling in opposite directions to form the superposition of the two waves: when the waves are in phase, they reinforce to form a wave with twice the amplitude, and when they are a half a wavelength out of phase, they cancel
\ The fundamental frequency and wavelength of a wave are the lowest frequency and wavelength possible, when there is only one antinode
\ The fundamental wavelength is double the length of the standing wave
\ Harmonics or overtones occur when the wave has multiple antinodes, which have frequencies that are multiples of the fundamental frequency directly proportional to the number of antinodes, and wavelengths that are inversely proportional to the number of antinodes
2 ![](/alevel/img/stationary_wave.svg)
\ Nodes are the points with the minimum amplitude
\ Antinodes are the points with the maximum amplitude, and occur at the midpoints of nodes

2.3.5
1 Path difference is the difference in phase of two waves with the same frequency
\ Coherence is the property of two waves that have the same frequency and constant phase difference
2 A laser produces light that is coherent, as well as being spatially coherent, so that it can be focused on a single spot and not spread out over a long distance; it can also be monochromatic, whereby its light has a single frequency/wavelength
\ Non-laser light must be passed through a single slit to make it coherent
\ Lasers can damage the retina if looked at directly
4 Two sources must be coherent; the phase difference affects the offset of the fringes
5 \\(w\\) is the fringe spacing, \\(\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the light and \\(D\\) is the distance from the slits to the surface where the fringes are produced
\ \\(D\\) must be large enough so that the diffraction observed is Fraunhofer diffraction, not near-field diffraction

2.3.6
1 When a wave, such as light, passes through a thin slit, it diffracts, spreading out in the shape of a semicircle; the diffraction waves generated at different points in the slit interfere with each other, resulting in the formation of a diffraction pattern
\ The central fringe is twice the size of the other fringes, and much brighter
2 A diffraction grating expands the double-slit concept to several slits, with the interference from multiple diffraction waves reinforcing the diffraction pattern to produce clear lines of constructive interference at certain angles
\ A spectrometer can use the produced angles of interference to calculate the wavelengths present in the incoming light
3 ![](/alevel/img/diffraction_grating.svg)
\ By comparing two adjacent slits, the results of interference at different angles of diffraction can be determined by considering the extra distance travelled from the farther slit: if the light travels an extra integer number of wavelengths, then they are at the same point of the cycle, causing the waves to constructively interfere
\ Since the extra distance travelled is \\(d\sin\theta\\) where \\(d\\) is the slit separation and \\(\theta\\) is the angle of diffraction, with the wavelength \\(\lambda\\), this gives rise to the equation \\(d\sin\theta = n\lambda\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer, the order number
\ The maximum order number can be found by considering that the angle cannot be greater than 90°: \\(n < \frac{d}{\lambda}\\)
4 Directing the light from stars through a diffraction grating causes the different wavelengths present in the light to diffract at different angles, forming a spectrum that can be used for spectral analysis

4.1.1
1 Constant mass gives \\(F = m\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = ma\\), Newton's second law
2 Impulse is the result of a force over time
3 The area under a force-time graph gives the impulse of the force
4 In a closed system, momentum is conserved
5 The elasticity of a collision between two bodies denotes the ratio of the difference in velocity after the collision to before the collision
\ A completely elastic collision results in the two bodies moving apart at the same speed as before the collision
\ An inelastic collision results in the two bodies moving at the same velocity, touching
\ In an explosion, two bodies initially at rest recoil to move apart with equal and opposite momentum

4.1.2
1 Otherwise the body would move in a straight line tangent to the circle
\ The centripetal force is towards the centre of the circle
2 Angular velocity is the rate of change of angular displacement, and is measured in radians per second
3 Centripetal acceleration is the acceleration required to keep the body on a circular path
4 From \\(F = ma\\)
5 Rudimentary derivation:
\ ![](../img/centripetal_acceleration.svg)
\ From \\(s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2\\), \\(u = 0\\) so \\(s = \frac{1}{2}a\delta t^2\\)
\ But \\((s+r)^2 = r^2 + (v\delta t)^2\\)
\ So
\ \\[\begin{align}
\              & s^2 + 2sr = v^2\delta t^2
\ \\\ \implies & \frac{1}{4}a^2\delta t^4 + ar\delta t^2 = v^2\delta t^2
\ \\\ \implies & \frac{1}{4}a^2\delta t^2 + ar = v^2
\ \end{align}\\]
\ \\(\delta t\\) tends to 0, so \\(ar = v^2\\)
\ Or \\(a = \frac{v^2}{r}\\)

4.1.4
1 The force of a mass oscillating on the end of a spring is \\(F = -kx\\) so \\(a = -\frac{k}{m}x\\), which is the form for shm where \\((2\pi f)^2 = \frac{k}{m}\\)
\ This gives \\(T = \frac{1}{f} = 2\pi\sqrt\frac{m}{k}\\)
2 The force of a mass oscillating on the end of a pendulum is \\(F = -mg\sin\theta\\) so \\(a = -g\sin\theta\\)
\ At small values of \\(\theta\\) (\\(<\SI{10}{\degree}\\)), \\(\sin\theta \approx \frac{x}{L}\\), so \\(a = -\frac{g}{l}x\\), which is the form for shm, where \\((2\pi f)^2 = \frac{g}{l}\\)
\ This gives \\(T = \frac{1}{f} = 2\pi\sqrt\frac{l}{g}\\)
3 The potential energy stored in the spring as measured from the origin is \\(E_p = \frac{1}{2}kx^2\\)
\ Since it is a closed system, energy is conserved, so at the maximum displacement, where kinetic energy is 0, the total energy is equal to the potential energy, so \\(E_t = \frac{1}{2}kA^2\\), where \\(A\\) is the amplitude
\ It follows that the kinetic energy is equal to \\(E_k = E_t - E_p = \frac{1}{2}k(A^2 - x^2)\\)
\ The velocity is \\(v = \pm\sqrt\frac{2E_k}{m} = \pm\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}(A^2 - x^2)}\\)
\ Since \\((2\pi f)^2 = \frac{k}{m}\\), \\(v = \pm\sqrt{(2πf)^2(A^2 - x^2)} = \pm 2\pi f\sqrt{(A^2 - x^2)}\\)

4.1.5
1 Free vibrations occur without an input force at the natural frequency of the system
\ Forced vibrations have a periodic force applied to keep it oscillating
2 Resonance occurs when the frequency of forced vibrations is equal to the natural frequency and in phase with the velocity, causing the amplitude to become very large
\ Damping reduces the sharpness of resonance
3 When the system is in resonance, the driver is \\(\frac{\pi}{2}\\) out of phase with the driven system
\ Below the resonant frequency, the phase difference is less than \\(\frac{\pi}{2}\\)
\ Above the resonant frequency, the phase difference is greater than \\(\frac{\pi}{2}\\), approaching \\(\pi\\)

4.2.1
2 The force of gravity between two masses is directly proportional to (the product of) their masses and inversely proportional to the the square of the distance between them

1 In a magnetic field, a current-carrying wire perpendicular to the direction of the field experiences a force perpendicular to both, namely the direction in which the magnetic effect of the current counteracts the field
2 \\(F\\) is the force in newtons
\ \\(B\\) is the magnetic flux density in teslas
\ \\(I\\) is the current in the wire in amperes
\ \\(l\\) is the length of the wire in metres
3 Fleming's left hand rule is a visual mnemonic to work out the direction of the force on a current-carrying wire, where the middle finger denotes the direction of the current, the index finger the field, and the thumb the force
4 Magnetic flux density measures the strength of a magnetic field to induce a force in a moving charged particle, and is measured in teslas, where \\(\SI{1}{\tesla} = \SI{1}{\newton\per\metre\per\ampere}\\)

4.5.2
1 In a magnetic field, charged particles moving perpendicular to the direction of the field experiences a force perpendicular to both; since this changes the direction of movement, it also changes the direction of the force
2 \\(F\\) is the force in newtons
\ \\(B\\) is the magnetic flux density in teslas
\ \\(Q\\) is the charge of the particles in coulombs
\ \\(v\\) is the velocity in metres per second
3 Since the force is always perpendicular to motion, the particles move in circular motion, with radius \\(r = \frac{mv}{BQ}\\)
\ A cyclotron is a particle accelerator that uses a magnetic and electric field in two semicircular dees to accelerate charged particles outwards in a spiral path until it leaves the edge in a straight line

1 Magnetic flux is the total B-field strength in an area, and is measured in webers, where \\(\SI{1}{\weber} = \SI{1}{\tesla\metre\squared}\\)
\ \\(B\\) is the magnetic flux density in teslas
\ \\(A\\) is the area of the surface in metres squared
2 Flux linkage is the magnetic flux passing through a coil, and is the aggregate of the flux passing through each turn
3 The flux and flux linkage passing through a rotating coil is constantly changing depending on its angle in the field
4 The more the field is passing perpendicular through the coil and the less it is passing parallel through the coil, the larger the flux linkage
\ If the field is perpendicular to the coil, then the flux linkage is zero

4.5.4
1 A moving conductor in a magnetic field induces an emf in the conductor, as long as it cuts flux lines
\ A static current-carrying conductor in a changing magnetic field induces an emf in the conductor
\ A rectangular coil entering a magnetic field induces an emf in the coil until it is fully in the field
2 Faraday's law: the induced emf is equal to the negative of the rate of change of flux linkage
\ Lenz's law: the direction of induced current opposes the change producing it
3 From Lenz's law, the direction is opposite to the rate of change, so it is more accurately: \\(\varepsilon = -N\frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}\\)
\ This is known as back emf
4 If moving straight conductor has length \\(l\\) and moves a distance \\(s\\) perpendicular to the field, then the change in flux linkage is \\(\Delta\Phi = B\Delta A = Bl\Delta s\\), so the induced emf is
\ \\[\begin{align}
\ \varepsilon & = N\frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}
\ \\\         & = 1\frac{Bl\Delta s}{\Delta t}
\ \\\         & = Bl\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}
\ \\\         & = Blv
\ \end{align}\\]
5 The flux linkage is \\(N\Phi = BAN\sin\theta = BAN\sin(\omega t)\\) so the induced emf is
\ \\[\begin{align}
\ \varepsilon & =\frac{N\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}
\ \\\         & = N\frac{\Delta(BA\sin(\omega t))}{\Delta t}
\ \\\         & = BAN\frac{\Delta(\sin(\omega t))}{\Delta t}
\ \\\         & = BAN\omega\cos(\omega t)
\ \end{align}\\]
6 Where \\(\omega\\ = 2\pi f\\) is the angular frequency, and \\(f\\) is the frequency of rotation in hertz
7 A transformer transfers energy from one circuit, the primary circuit, to another, the secondary circuit; it consists of two coils wound round a common iron core; an alternating current in the primary coil induces an alternating magnetic field in the core, which in turn induces an alternating current in the secondary coil
8 Transformer efficiency compares the energy in the circuit after transformation to before
\ Transformers are almost 100% efficient
9 Resistance in the wire causes heating equal to \\(I^2R\\)
\ Eddy currents are induced in the iron core, which is minimised by partitioning the core with insulating layers
\ Energy is wasted to repeatedly magnetise and demagnetise the iron core due to hysteresis
10 Since the power wasted is proportional to current squared and inversely proportional to voltage squared, it is much more efficient energy efficient to transfer electrical power at high voltage
\ Transformers are used in transmission by stepping-up the voltage before transmission and stepping-down the voltage after transmission

1 Rutherford scattering is the observation that when alpha particles are fired through thin gold foil only a few atoms thick, while most passed through hardly deflected, a small proportion, of less than 1 in 8000, are deflected by a large angle of over 90 degrees
\ This lead to the development of the modern atomic model that it is mostly empty space with a small dense positively-charged nucleus in the centre surrounded by the electrons, superceding the previous plum-pudding model, where the positive charge is spread throughout the atom and would otherwise be unable to exert the large forces observed in the gold foil experiment
\ Same energy?

5.1.2
1 The different types of radiation can be identified by its different properties, most simply by their different levels of absorption: alpha radiation is absorbed by a few centimetres of air or a sheet of paper or metal foil; beta radiation is absorbed by a metre or so of air or a few millimetres of metal; gamma radiation is absorbed by several centimetres of lead but not by air
\ Alpha particles have the strongest ionising effect and gamma particles have the weaking ionising effect
\ In a cloud chamber, alpha & beta particles leave tracks of condensed vapour droplets due to their ionising effect on the air: alpha particles produce distinct straight tracks of the same length from the source; beta particles produce more wispy tracks
\ In a magnetic field, due to their respective charges, alpha particles are deflected towards the negative, beta particles are deflected more strongly to the positive and gamma particles are not deflected
2 The intensity of gamma radiation a distance from its source follows the inverse square law: the intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance
\ This can be verified experimentally by measuring the intensity of radiation at different distances from the source using a Geiger-Müller tube & counter, and verifying that plotting intensity against the reciprocal of distance squared follows a linear regression, or that the product of intensity with distance squared is constant
3 Background radiation is a naturally-occuring radiation and must be subtracted from measurements of radiation
\ Origins:
\
\ * radon gas in the air
\ * man-made radiation due to medical or industrial uses
\ * rocks in the ground and buildings
\ * carbon-14 in living things
\ * cosmic rays
\ * nuclear weapons
\ * air travel
\ * nuclear power

5.1.3
1 Radioactive decay is random because it is impossible to predict when a single atom will decay
\ Each nucleus has a constant probability \\(\lambda\\) to decay
\ \\[\begin{align}
\              & \frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\lambda N
\ \\\ \implies & \frac{1}{N}\frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\lambda
\ \\\ \implies & \int N^{-1} \mathrm{d}N = \int -\lambda \mathrm{d}t
\ \\\ \implies & \ln N = -\lambda t + \ln N_0
\ \\\ \implies & Q = N_0e^{-\lambda t}
\ \end{align}\\]
2 Activity is measured in units Becquerels \\(\si{\becquerel}\\), equal to decays per second \\(\si{\per\second}\\)
3 Derivation of half life:
\ \\[\begin{align}
\              & \frac{1}{2}N_0 = N_0e^{-\lambda T_\frac{1}{2}}
\ \\\ \implies & \ln\frac{1}{2} = -\lambda T_\frac{1}{2}
\ \\\ \implies & T_\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}
\ \end{align}\\]
\ Half life can be determined from graphical data by measuring the time it takes for the number of nuclei to half, once or a number of times
\ The half life of radioactive waste is important because substances with a higher half life remain dangerous for longer
\ The half life of carbon-14 is useful for the dating of dead matter since its radioactivity can be compared to a sample of the living equivalent to calculate when it died

4 A nuclear excited state is any state of the nucleus that is not in its ground state, where it has minimum energy, and is common after radioactive decay
\ Excited states are usually short-lived and the excess energy is released in the form of a gamma ray emission wherein the photon(s) carries the same energy as the energy removed from the system
\ Technetium-99m is a metastable nuclear isomer, which means it is an unstable excited state of technetium-99, but is much more stable than conventional excited nuclei, and therefore is used as a source of gamma rays in medical uses such as monitoring blood flow or imaging internal organs, since it survives long enough in the body to collect data, but not long enough in order to minimise radiation exposure; the gamma rays it emits are also a similar wavelength to conventional X-ray diagnostic equipment

5.1.5

2 Binding energy is the energy required to disassemble a nucleus into its nucleons and is calculated from the total energy of the unbound nucleons minus the energy of the nucleus
\ This also applies to atoms when electrons are included
3 The atomic mass unit is one twelfth of the mass of an unbound carbon-12 atom, equal to \\(\SI{1}{\gram\per\mole}\\), and is approximately the mass of one nucleon
\ \\(\SI{1}{\amu} = \SI{1.66 \cdot 10^{-27}}{\kilogram}\\)

5 Nuclear fusion is when small nuclei fuse to form a larger nucleus which has a higher binding energy per nucleon
\ Nuclear fission is when a large unstable nucleus splits into smaller nuclei which have a higher binding energy per nucleon

5.2.2
1 Nuclear fission can be induced by bombarding the nucleus with a thermal neutron: a free neutron with the right energy to induce fission
\ Nuclear fission releases neutrons, which can collide with another nucleus to induce another fission event, causing a chain reaction; the more nuclei there are, the higher the probability of a chain reaction
\ Critical mass is the minimum amount of fissile material needed to sustain a nuclear chain reaction
2 In a nuclear reactor, the moderator is required to slow fast-moving fission neutrons into thermal neutrons that can induce further fission events
\ The atoms of a moderator should be close to the mass of the neutron to impart maximum kinetic energy, and should also be stable, so graphite or water is often used
\ Control rods regulate the amount of fission occuring from its position in the reactor that causes it to absorb varied numbers of neutrons, in order to prevent the reaction from going out of control, but allowing it to be sustained
\ Control rods must be able to absorb a large number of neutrons without fissioning, so are often made of boron, silver, indium or cadmium
\ The coolant removes heat from the reactor to drive electric generators
\ The coolant is generally water, but can be a gas such as helium or carbon dioxide

5.2.3
1 The reactor is shielded with thick steel to withstand the high temperatures & pressures in the core, and to absorb neutrons and beta & gamma radiation; further, the building has very thick concrete walls to absorb neutrons and gamma radiation that escape the core
\ The emergency shut-down system completely stops fission by inserting the control rods fully into the reactor
2 The fission products are neutron-rich active beta particle emitters and so highly radioactive, so must be handled and disposed with care according to regulations
\ High-level radioactive waste from spent fuel rods are removed by remote control and stored in cooling ponds, due to the heat generated by its radioactivity, for up to a year before the unused uranium & plutonium is extracted for further possible use and the remainder is stored in sealed containers in deep trenches or underground, away from water sources, since it still contains long-lived radioactive isotopes

5.3.1
1 In a closed system, changes in energy can be equated due to the law of conservation of energy
2 The specific heat capacity of a substance is the amount of thermal energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of the substance by one Kelvin
3 While a substance is changing state, its energy changes without changing temperature
\ The specific latent of a substance is the amount of thermal energy required to change the state of a kilogram of the substance

5.3.2
2 Absolute zero is the lower limit of the temperature scale, at which an ideal gas reaches its minimum enthalpy and entropy of 0
\ It cannot be reached in real world scenarios
3 The pressure of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles and the temperature, and inversely proportional to the volume, where R is the molar gas constant
\ The pressure of a gas is directly proportional to the number of molecules and the temperature, and inversely proportional to the volume, where k is the Boltzmann constant
4 The Avogadro constant is the number of particles in one mole of a substance and is approximately \\(\SI{6.022\cdot 10^{23}}{\per\mole}\\)
\ The molar gas constant is the constant of proportionality in the ideal gas law and is approximately \\(\SI{8.31}{\joule\per\kelvin\per\mole}\\)
\ The Boltzmann constant is the gas constant divided by the Avogadro constant and is approximately \\(\SI{1.38\cdot 10^{-23}}{\joule\per\kelvin}\\)
5 The molar mass of a substance is the mass of one mole of the substance
\ The molecular mass of a molecule is the total mass of the atoms in it

5.3.3
1 In a simple molecular model, particles are modelled as point masses that travel randomly in a straight line until colliding with the boundary or another particle, which exerts a force
\ Increasing the volume decreases the pressure since the particles have to travel farther, so impact with the boundary less often, therefore reducing the pressure
\ Increasing the pressure increases the temperature since the particles move faster, so impact with the boundary more often, therefore raising the temperature
2 \\(c_{rms}\\) is the root mean square speed of the molecules of gas
\ Assumptions:
\
\ * the molecules are point masses, so the volume of one is negligible compared to the whole gas
\ * there are no intermolecular forces, otherwise this would reduce the force of impact with the boundary
\ * the collisions are elastic, so there is no loss of energy
\ * the collision time is negligible compared to the time between impacts
\
\ Derivation:
\
\ * consider a molecule of gas with mass \\(m\\) in a cuboid container with dimensions \\(l_x, l_y, l_z\\) in the \\(x, y, z\\) axes respectively
\ * suppose the velocity vector of the molecule is \begin{pmatrix}u\\\v\\\w\end{pmatrix} then the speed of the molecule is \\(c^2 = u^2 + v^2 + w^2\\)
\ * considering, without loss of generality, just the motion in the x-direction, the time between collisions with one of the faces is \\(t = \frac{2l_x}{u}\\) and the change in momentum of the collision is \\(-mu - mu = -2mu\\)
\ * therefore, the force on the molecule is \\(F = \frac{\Delta(mv)}{\Delta t} = \frac{-2mu}{\frac{2l_x}{u}} = -\frac{mu^2}{l_x}\\), which, by Newton's third law of motion, is equal & opposite to the force on the face
\ * thus, the pressure of the molecule on the face is \\(p = \frac{-F}{A} = \frac{\frac{mu^2}{l_x}}{l_yl_z} = \frac{mu^2}{l_xl_yl_z} = \frac{mu^2}{V}\\) where \\(V\\) is the volume of the container
\ * now considering N molecules in the container, each with a mass of \\(m\\), with the nth molecule having velocity vector \begin{pmatrix}u_n\\\v_n\\\w_n\end{pmatrix} and exerting a pressure of \\(p_1\\) on the face, the total pressure on the face is \\[p_u = \sum^N_{n=1}\frac{mu_n^2}{V} = \frac{m}{V}\sum^N_{n=1}u_n^2 = \frac{m}{V}N\overline{u^2}\\]
\ * since the x-direction was chosen without loss of generality, it follows that the pressure in the other two directions are \\(p_v = \frac{m}{V}N\overline{v^2}\\) and \\(p_w = \frac{m}{V}N\overline{w^2}\\)
\ * therefore, the mean pressure on a face is \\[\begin{align}
\   p & = \frac{p_u + p_v + p_w}{3}
\ \\\ & = \frac{1}{3}(\frac{m}{V}N\overline{u^2} + \frac{m}{V}N\overline{v^2} + \frac{m}{V}N\overline{w^2})
\ \\\ & = \frac{1}{3V}Nm(\overline{u^2} + \overline{v^2} + \overline{w^2})
\ \\\ &= \frac{1}{3V}Nmc_{rms}^2
\ \end{align}\\]
\ since
\ \\[\begin{align}
\ c_{rms}^2 & = \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}{c_n^2}
\ \\\       & = \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}(u_n^2 + v_n^2 + w_n^2)
\ \\\       & = \\frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}{u_n^2} + \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}{v_n^2} + \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}{w_n^2}
\ \\\       & = \overline{u^2} + \overline{v^2} + \overline{w^2}
\ \end{align}\\]
\ * re-arranging gives \\(pV = \frac{1}{3}Nmc_{rms}^2\\)
3 Summing the kinetic energy of each particle gives \\(\frac{1}{2}m(c_{rms})^2\\)
\ Since \\(pV = \frac{1}{3}Nmc_{rms}^2\\) and \\(pV = NkT\\), \\(\frac{1}{2}m(c_{rms})^2 = \frac{3}{2N}pV = \frac{3}{2}kT\\)
\ Since \\(k = \frac{R}{N_A}\\), \\(\frac{3}{2}kT = \frac{3RT}{2N_A}\\)

6.2.2
1 Non-flow processes are changes of a gas that does not flow across the boundary of its container
\ Isothermal changes occur at a constant temperature
\ Adiabatic changes do not allow heat transfer to or from the gas, so it may have a different temperature to the outside system
\ Constant pressure changes occur at a constant pressure
\ Constant volume changes occur at a constant volume
2 This is the ideal gas law
3 \\(\gamma\\) is the adiabatic index, and is necessary since the lack of heat transfer causes the temperature to change, rising with pressure
\ \\(\gamma\\) is \\(\frac{5}{3}\\) for a monatomic gas, \\(\frac{7}{5}\\) for a diatomic gas and \\(\frac{4}{3}\\) for a polyatomic gas
4 This follows directly from the ideal gas law since \\(T\\) is assumed to be constant

4 A cyclic process consists of a number of p-V changes but ultimately returns to its original p-V state (and repeats)
\ If the p-V curve of a cyclic process forms a loop, then the work done on the gas is not equal to the work done by the gas, and the net work done is equal to the area of the loop

\ * 1 → 2 - Compression: The valve closes and the air is compressed adiabatically, raising the pressure
\ * 2 → 3 - Ignition: A spark ignites the mixture while it remains compressed, further increasing the pressure & temperuature greatly
\ * 3 → 4 - Expansion: The increased pressure forces the piston back outwards and the gas expands adiabatically, returning to its original volume and decreasing the pressure
\ * 4 → 1 - Cooling: The gas cools as it touches the internal walls of the cylinder, causing the pressure to return to its initial state
\ * 1 → 0 - Exhaust: The exhaust valve opens and the piston compresses to force the exhaust gas out, and the process repeats

\ Processes:
\
\ * 1 → 2 - Compression: The air in the cylinder is compressed to about 5% of its original volume (compared to about 10% in a petrol engine)
\ * 2 → 3 - Fuel injection: Diesel fuel is sprayed into the cylinder, igniting upon contact with the air, pushing the piston out at constant pressure
\ * 3 → 4 - Expansion: Upon completion of combustion, the air is at a higher temperature, so expands adiabatically back to its original volume
\ * 4 → 1 - Cooling: The exhaust valve opens and the pressure falls back to its original atmospheric temperature, and the exhaust gas is released, drawing in fresh air
\ These theoretical diagrams are only a model of ideal engines, and in a diagram of real world performance these processes are not so clearly defined due to inefficiencies:
\
\ * the corners are rounded since valves take time to open & close
\ * ignition cannot occur with constant volume since either the pressure & temperature would have to instantly change, or the piston would have to stop, which does not happen
\ * some of the work is used to overcome friction
\ * the temperature does not reach its theoretical value since the fuel does not fully combust
\
\ The calorific value of the fuel is expressed in energy per mass \\(\si{\joule\per\kilogram}\\) and the fuel flow rate is expressed in mass per time \\(\si{\kilogram\per\second}\\)
2 The indicated power is the total amount of work done in a second by every cylinder
4 Friction power is the total power wasted due to friction
