The energy of the photon that is emitted when an electron de-excites is equal to the difference in energy of the levels<br>
Fluorescence occurs when certain materials absorb ultraviolet light because an electron absorbs a photon, exciting it up multiple energy levels, before cascading down more than one energy level, releasing photons with lower energy than the incoming photon, which can put the frequency in the visible spectrum</p></td>

Brittle materials have a rigid structure, so will not display plastic behaviour and, and break when the force is too great without and noticeable yield<br>
Fractures occur in brittle materials when stress causes cracks in the material to grow until it breaks completely; fractures do not occur in plastic materials because atoms can move to stop the cracks from growing<br>
Materials may behave differently when loading to unloading: if so, the area inside the curve is equal to the net work done; below the elastic limit, the unloading graph returns to the origin, but it does not when above<br>
<img alt="" src="/alevel/img/stress-strain_curves.svg"><br>
As the strain increases, the stress rises proportionally up to P, and then continues to increase past E until the first yield point<br>
Past the yield point, the material undergoes necking, whereby the material weakens and the and part of the material thins<br>
The ultimate tensile stress is the maximum stress the material can withstand<br>
The material then weakens until the breaking point<br>
For a brittle material, the ultimate tensile stress is the breaking point</p></td>

Polarised sunglasses are polarised to attenuate glare on surfaces, since when light is scattered off a surface, it is mostly polarised in the direction parallel to the surface; this improves the visibility of the scene<br>
Radio transmitters are polarised, so receivers must be rotated in the same direction in order to receive the strongest signal</p></td>

This lead to the development of the modern atomic model that it is mostly empty space with a small dense positively-charged nucleus in the centre surrounded by the electrons, superceding the previous plum-pudding model, where the positive charge is spread throughout the atom and would otherwise be unable to exert the large forces observed in the gold foil experiment<br>

            <td><p>\(c_{rms}\) is the root mean square speed of the molecules of gas<br>
Assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>the molecules are point masses, so the volume of one is negligible compared to the whole gas</li>
<li>there are no intermolecular forces, otherwise this would reduce the force of impact with the boundary</li>
<li>the collisions are elastic, so there is no loss of energy</li>
<li>the collision time is negligible compared to the time between impacts</li>
</ul>
<p>Derivation:</p>
<ul>
<li>consider a molecule of gas with mass \(m\) in a cuboid container with dimensions \(l_x, l_y, l_z\) in the \(x, y, z\) axes respectively</li>
<li>suppose the velocity vector of the molecule is \begin{pmatrix}u\\v\\w\end{pmatrix} then the speed of the molecule is \(c^2 = u^2 + v^2 + w^2\)</li>
<li>considering, without loss of generality, just the motion in the x-direction, the time between collisions with one of the faces is \(t = \frac{2l_x}{u}\) and the change in momentum of the collision is \(-mu - mu = -2mu\)</li>
<li>therefore, the force on the molecule is \(F = \frac{\Delta(mv)}{\Delta t} = \frac{-2mu}{\frac{2l_x}{u}} = -\frac{mu^2}{l_x}\), which, by Newton's third law of motion, is equal &amp; opposite to the force on the face</li>
<li>thus, the pressure of the molecule on the face is \(p = \frac{-F}{A} = \frac{\frac{mu^2}{l_x}}{l_yl_z} = \frac{mu^2}{l_xl_yl_z} = \frac{mu^2}{V}\) where \(V\) is the volume of the container</li>
<li>now considering N molecules in the container, each with a mass of \(m\), with the nth molecule having velocity vector \begin{pmatrix}u_n\\v_n\\w_n\end{pmatrix} and exerting a pressure of \(p_1\) on the face, the total pressure on the face is \[p_u = \sum^N_{n=1}\frac{mu_n^2}{V} = \frac{m}{V}\sum^N_{n=1}u_n^2 = \frac{m}{V}N\overline{u^2}\]</li>
<li>since the x-direction was chosen without loss of generality, it follows that the pressure in the other two directions are \(p_v = \frac{m}{V}N\overline{v^2}\) and \(p_w = \frac{m}{V}N\overline{w^2}\)</li>
<li>therefore, the mean pressure on a face is \[\begin{align}<br>
  p &amp; = \frac{p_u + p_v + p_w}{3}<br>
\\ &amp; = \frac{1}{3}(\frac{m}{V}N\overline{u^2} + \frac{m}{V}N\overline{v^2} + \frac{m}{V}N\overline{w^2})<br>
\\ &amp; = \frac{1}{3V}Nm(\overline{u^2} + \overline{v^2} + \overline{w^2})<br>
\\ &amp;= \frac{1}{3V}Nmc_{rms}^2<br>
\end{align}\]<br>
since<br>
\[\begin{align}<br>
c_{rms}^2 &amp; = \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}{c_n^2}<br>
\\       &amp; = \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}(u_n^2 + v_n^2 + w_n^2)<br>
\\       &amp; = \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}{u_n^2} + \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}{v_n^2} + \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{n=1}{w_n^2}<br>
\\       &amp; = \overline{u^2} + \overline{v^2} + \overline{w^2}<br>

Otto cycle for petrol engines:<br>
<img alt="" src="/alevel/img/otto_cycle.svg"><br>
Processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 → 1 - Intake: The intake valve opens to draw a cool petrol-air mixturce at atmospheric temperature into the cylinder</li>
<li>1 → 2 - Compression: The valve closes and the air is compressed adiabatically, raising the pressure</li>
<li>2 → 3 - Ignition: A spark ignites the mixture while it remains compressed, further increasing the pressure &amp; temperuature greatly</li>
<li>3 → 4 - Expansion: The increased pressure forces the piston back outwards and the gas expands adiabatically, returning to its original volume and decreasing the pressure</li>
<li>4 → 1 - Cooling: The gas cools as it touches the internal walls of the cylinder, causing the pressure to return to its initial state</li>
<li>1 → 0 - Exhaust: The exhaust valve opens and the piston compresses to force the exhaust gas out, and the process repeats</li>
</ul>
<p>Diesel cycle for diesel engines:<br>
<img alt="" src="/alevel/img/diesel_cycle.svg"><br>
Processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 → 2 - Compression: The air in the cylinder is compressed to about 5% of its original volume (compared to about 10% in a petrol engine)</li>
<li>2 → 3 - Fuel injection: Diesel fuel is sprayed into the cylinder, igniting upon contact with the air, pushing the piston out at constant pressure</li>
<li>3 → 4 - Expansion: Upon completion of combustion, the air is at a higher temperature, so expands adiabatically back to its original volume</li>
<li>
<p>4 → 1 - Cooling: The exhaust valve opens and the pressure falls back to its original atmospheric temperature, and the exhaust gas is released, drawing in fresh air<br>
These theoretical diagrams are only a model of ideal engines, and in a diagram of real world performance these processes are not so clearly defined due to inefficiencies:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the corners are rounded since valves take time to open &amp; close</p>
</li>
<li>ignition cannot occur with constant volume since either the pressure &amp; temperature would have to instantly change, or the piston would have to stop, which does not happen</li>
<li>some of the work is used to overcome friction</li>
<li>the temperature does not reach its theoretical value since the fuel does not fully combust</li>
</ul>
